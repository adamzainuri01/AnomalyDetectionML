# Classification and Regression Machine Learning Model Approach for Anomaly Detection in Oil and Gas Pipelines

## General Information
A classification and regression approach to detect anomalies in oil and gas pipelines made with python using various different models. The dataset used were obtained from https://github.com/Abimbola-ai/Oil-and-gas-pipeline-leakage

## Machine Learning Model Used
### Classification Model
1. Random Forest
2. Decision Tree
3. Support Vector Machine
4. XGBoost
5. K-Nearest Neighbor
6. Multi Layer Perceptron
### Regression Model
1. Random Forest
2. Decision Tree
3. Elastic Net
4. XGBoost
5. K-Nearest Neighbor
6. Multi Layer Perceptron

## Running Program Locally
### Required Modules
1. pandas
2. numpy
3. matplotlib
4. seaborn
### Running the Program
1. Put generated_dataset.csv, Classification_Model.ipynb, and Regression_Model.ipynb in the same folder.
2. Run in order Classification_Model.ipynb and then Regression_Model.ipynb.
3. The result should be shown in a new file called CR Prediction.xlsx and a collection of confusion matrix, feature importance, ROC-AUC curve, and correlation matrix images for each models.
